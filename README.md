BigLittlePaiProgram Version 1

This is a Program to auto assign big-little pairs based off of relative rankings of eachother


Instructions: 
1. Download the files
2. run the installer (setup.exe).
3. Allow installation (trust me, I am not smart enough to program a virus)
4. set up your CSVs so that the column headers have the following tags inclusded in the cooresponding columns:
  name= FN,
  roll number= ROLL,
  (Big/Little)Choice 1= CH1,
  (Big/Little)Choice 5= CH5
5. specify the correct directory of CSVs ie: "C:\Desktop\Brothers.csv"
6. Click the "generate" button.
7. If it doesnt work, text me


I have written features to assist in making sure all names are entered correctly, I just became busy and didnt implement them.

NOTE: I assume that choices 2-4 exist sequentially between CH1 and CH5 so they do not need to be tagged, 
  if the columns are not in that order the program will not work correctly. All other columns will be ignored
